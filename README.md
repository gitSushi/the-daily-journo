## History

Wanting to work on my own project, I started with the design of blog post app. It turned into a newspaper-like microblogging app The Daily Journo. Here is the [codepen version](https://codepen.io/gitsushi/pen/dyYgdZd/left).

However it is a React only app and I wanted to show a little more of my skills with this project. So I added Redux. It made for a good code refactoring exercise.

## Behind the scenes

It is a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) features to give the illusion of an actual fully functional blogging app.

Enjoy and happy coding !
